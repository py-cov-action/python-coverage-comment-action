## Setup coverage badge

Below are examples of the badges you can use in your main branch `README` file.

### Direct image

[![Coverage badge]({{ direct_image_url }})]({{ html_report_url if is_public else readme_url }})

This is the one to use if your repository is private or if you don't want to customize anything.

{% if is_public -%}
### [Shields.io](https://shields.io) Json Endpoint

[![Coverage badge]({{ endpoint_image_url }})]({{html_report_url}})

Using this one will allow you to [customize](https://shields.io/endpoint) the look of your badge.
It won't work with private repositories. It won't be refreshed more than once per five minutes.

### [Shields.io](https://shields.io) Dynamic Badge

[![Coverage badge]({{ dynamic_image_url }})]({{ html_report_url }})

This one will always be the same color. It won't work for private repos. I'm not even sure why we included it.
